Noto unicode font for OpenStreetMap & MapBox GL -
https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts

Manually merged Google Noto fonts (https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to provide glyphs for unicode OpenStreetMap labels in TileServer GL, MapBox GL JS, Android and iOS.

Feel free to use these fonts in your styles on your servers, but you must keep the name of the font as it is in this repository - to credit KlokanTech for the work we have done on merging the Google Noto.
