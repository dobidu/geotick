--------------------
TICK uses [JUCE](https://www.juce.com) framework.

[JUX](https://github.com/talaviram/jux) -
During TICK, I've started seeing there are many missing UX elements that would be nice to have with JUCE. so I've separated those to JUX.

TICK itself is MIT.
JUCE and VST3 are GPL/dual-licensed.
